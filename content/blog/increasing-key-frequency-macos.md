It has been quite a while since the last post on my old [personal blog](http://musingsofaprogrammingaddict.blogspot.com/);
since then, I've mostly focused on writing about my day-work on the [Debezium blog](https://debezium.io/blog/) as well as [some posts](https://in.relation.to/gunnar-morling/) about more general technical topics on the Hibernate team blog.

Now recently I had some ideas for things I wanted to write about, which didn't feel like a good fit for neither of those two.
So it was time to re-boot a personal blog.
As the previous Blogger based one really, really feels outdated by now and I also wanted to have more control over how things work, I decided to build the site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, and also use a nice new shiny dev domain.
And here we are, welcome to [morling.dev](/)!

Stay tuned for more posts every now and then about anything related to open source, the projects I work on and software engineering in general.
Onwards!
