I am an open-source software engineer, currently working at https://www.decodable.co/[Decodable], involved with data streaming based on Apache Flink.
Before joining Decodable, I spent ten years at Red Hat, where I led the Debezium project, a platform for change data capture.

I have been a long-time committer to multiple link:/projects[open-source projects], including Hibernate, kcctl, JfrUnit, MapStruct and Deptective;
I also serve as the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (first at the JCP, now under the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse Foundation).

Named a https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:3::::::[Java Champion], I'm regularly link:/conferences[speaking] at conferences such as QCon, JavaOne, Red Hat Summit, JavaZone, JavaLand and Kafka Summit.

Occasionally, I link:/blog[blog] about topics related to software engineering.
