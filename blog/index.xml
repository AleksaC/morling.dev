      <description>As a software engineer, I like to automate tedious tasks as much as possible. The deployment of this website is no exception: it is built using the Hugo static site generator and hosted on GitHub Pages; so wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice if the rendered website would automatically be published whenever an update is pushed to its source code repository?
 With the advent of GitHub Actions, tasks like this can easily be implemented without having to rely on any external CI service.</description>

      <description>It has been quite a while since the last post on my old personal blog; since then, I&#39;ve mostly focused on writing about my day-work on the Debezium blog as well as some posts about more general technical topics on the Hibernate team blog.
Now recently I had some ideas for things I wanted to write about, which didn&#39;t feel like a good fit for neither of those two. So it was time to re-boot a personal blog.</description>
