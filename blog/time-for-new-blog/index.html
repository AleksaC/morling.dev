			<p>It has been quite a while since the last post on my old <a href="http://musingsofaprogrammingaddict.blogspot.com/">personal blog</a>;
since then, I&rsquo;ve mostly focused on writing about my day-work on the <a href="https://debezium.io/blog/">Debezium blog</a> as well as <a href="https://in.relation.to/gunnar-morling/">some posts</a> about more general technical topics on the Hibernate team blog.</p>

<p>Now recently I had some ideas for things I wanted to write about, which didn&rsquo;t feel like a good fit for neither of those two.
So it was time to re-boot a personal blog.
As the previous Blogger based one really, really feels outdated by now and I also wanted to have more control over how things work, I decided to build the site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site generator, and also use a nice new shiny dev domain.
And here we are, welcome to <a href="/">morling.dev</a>!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more posts every now and then about anything related to open source, the projects I work on and software engineering in general.
Onwards!</p>
