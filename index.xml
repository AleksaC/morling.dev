      <description>I have contributed to a wide range of open-source projects over the last years. Here&amp;#8217;s a selection of projects I have been involved with.
  Debezium  Debezium is a platform for change data capture; it lets you stream changes out of different databases such as Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB and SQL Server into Apache Kafka. I am the current lead of the Debezium project.

      <title>Time for a New Blog</title>

      <description>It has been quite a while since the last post on my old personal blog; since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly focused on writing about my day-work on the Debezium blog as well as some posts about more general technical topics on the Hibernate team blog.
Now recently I had some ideas for things I wanted to write about, which didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a good fit for neither of those two. So it was time to re-boot a personal blog.</description>

      <description>I am an open-source software engineer, currently working for Red Hat, where I am leading the Debezium project, a platform for change data capture.
 I have been a long-time committer to multiple open-source projects, including Hibernate, MapStruct and Deptective; I also serve as the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (first at the JCP, now under the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse Foundation).
 Named a Java Champion, I&amp;#8217;m regularly speaking at conferences such as QCon, JavaOne, Red Hat Summit, JavaZone, JavaLand and Kafka Summit.</description>
